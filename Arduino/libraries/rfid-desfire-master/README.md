# RFID-DESFire #

Arduino library for MFRC522 and other RFID RC522 based modules.

This library extends the [MFRC522 library](https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid) adding extra functionality for MIFARE DESFire cards.

At the current stage no crypto has been implemented and a very limited subset of commands are available.

## Requirements ##
- [MFRC522 library](https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid)

### Future requirements ###
This libraries have been planned but need to be implemented and confirmed to be working properlly with DESFire library.

- [Arduino DES library](https://github.com/spaniakos/ArduinoDES/) (Not yet implemented)
- [Arduino AES library](https://github.com/spaniakos/AES/) (Not yet implemented)
